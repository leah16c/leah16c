## When?

My first major steps into coding began in November 2021 with the [School of Code](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode); through these intensive 16-week, I have been introduced to a wide range of different technologies, frameworks, libraries and tools that has given me the ability to work towards becoming a full-stack developer.

My interest mainly lies on the front-end, particularly with UX/UI design since I enjoy the design process and creating something both visually stimulating and usable. 

## Why?

After spending countless of hours pondering about life during the pandemic, it encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone and really make some changes, and on my way to many winding paths, there, I bumped into coding! Admittedly, there are times when I have no idea what's going on but there is something that sparks my inner flame and I'm curious to know more rather than shy away.

It will be a long journey ahead of me, but the continuous learning processes is what makes this something I want to pursue!
