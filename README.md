## Where?

Here, there... everywhere! üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

## When?

My first major steps into coding began in November 2021 with the [School of Code](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode); through these intensive 16-week, I have been introduced to a wide range of different technologies, frameworks, libraries and tools that has given me the ability to work towards becoming a full-stack developer.

My interest mainly lies on the front-end, particularly with UX/UI design since I enjoy the design process and creating something both visually stimulating and usable. 

## Why?

After spending countless of hours pondering about life during the pandemic, it encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone to make some major changes, and on my way to many winding paths, there, I bumped into coding! It will be a long journey ahead of me and admittedly there will be a lot of head scratching from me, but the continuous learning processes is what makes that sparks my inner flame and I'm curious to know more!
